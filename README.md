# High Performance Organizations Reading List

### Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency  
by Tom DeMarco  
https://www.amazon.com/Slack-Getting-Burnout-Busywork-Efficiency/dp/0767907698/

There is a tradeoff between efficiency (meeting previous well-defined needs with minimal effort) versus effectiveness (meeting newly emerging needs with flexibility and responsiveness through organizational learning). If you optimize only for efficiency in meeting previous needs from past opportunities, you will by neccessity eliminate your organizations's capacity to respond effectively to future needs from newly emerging opportunities. This ability to learn and grow as an organization requires "slack" time. Middle management has a vital role to play in organizational adaptibility -- but only if they are not overscheduled.

### The Happiness Track: How to Apply the Science of Happiness to Accelerate Your Success  
by Emma Seppala   
https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Track-Science-Accelerate-Success/dp/0062344005

"In The Happiness Track, Emma Seppala, the science director of the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education at Stanford University and director of the Yale College Emotional Intelligence Project, explains that our inability to achieve sustainable fulfillment is tied to common but outdated notions about success. We are taught that getting ahead means doing everything that’s thrown at us (and then some) with razor-sharp focus and iron discipline; that success depends on our drive and talents; and that achievement cannot happen without stress. The Happiness Track demolishes these counter-productive theories. Drawing on the latest findings from the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience—research on happiness, resilience, willpower, compassion, positive stress, creativity, mindfulness—Seppala shows that finding happiness and fulfillment may, in fact, be the most productive thing we can do to thrive professionally. Filled with practical advice on how to apply these scientific findings to our daily lives, The Happiness Track is a life-changing guide to fast tracking our success and creating the anxiety-free life we want."

### The Stupidity Paradox: The Power and Pitfalls of Functional Stupidity at Work Paperback
by Mats Alvesson  (Author), André Spicer (Author)  
https://www.amazon.com/Stupidity-Paradox-Power-Pitfalls-Functional/dp/1781255415

Suggests that most organizations hire smart and creative people and then don't allow them to be smart or creative due to organizational imperatives. 

A summary of the key points can be found in this essay by the author:

"Stupefied: How organisations enshrine collective stupidity and employees are rewarded for checking their brains at the office door"

### Carol Dweck's research on a growth mindset  
http://www.mindsetonline.com/

"Mindset is a simple idea discovered by world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck in decades of research on achievement and success—a simple idea that makes all the difference. Teaching a growth mindset creates motivation and productivity in the worlds of business, education, and sports."

"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success"  
https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322

"After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with agrowth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment."

### The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies  
by Scott E. Page  
https://www.amazon.com/Difference-Diversity-Creates-Schools-Societies/dp/0691138540

"In this landmark book, Scott Page redefines the way we understand ourselves in relation to one another. The Difference is about how we think in groups--and how our collective wisdom exceeds the sum of its parts. Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? And why are the best group decisions and predictions those that draw upon the very qualities that make each of us unique? The answers lie in diversity--not what we look like outside, but what we look like within, our distinct tools and abilities. The Difference reveals that progress and innovation may depend less on lone thinkers with enormous IQs than on diverse people working together and capitalizing on their individuality. Page shows how groups that display a range of perspectives outperform groups of like-minded experts."

### How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life  
by Caroline Webb  
https://www.amazon.com/How-Have-Good-Day-Behavioral/dp/0553419633  

"In How to Have a Good Day, economist and former McKinsey partner Caroline Webb shows readers how to use recent findings from behavioral economics, psychology, and neuroscience to transform our approach to everyday working life."

### Pros and cons of open plan office space

"58% of High-Performance Employees Say They Need More Quiet Work Spaces"  
https://slashdot.org/story/17/03/15/1911253/58-of-high-performance-employees-say-they-need-more-quiet-work-spaces  
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/15/58-of-high-performance-employees-say-they-need-more-quiet-work-spaces.html

One insightful comment there by Maxo-Texas:  
  "Seriously, it's a complex subject because  
  * different kinds of projects require different environment.  
  * different kinds of people require different environments.  
  * different kinds of work require different environments.  
  And unfortunately offices are associated with status so some people who don't care about quiet are going to require an office if others are getting offices."

### On overcoming a natural disconnect between executives and high-performance employees

"Know the soul of the high-performance employee, then we can build the 10,000 things"  
by William Belk  
https://hackernoon.com/know-the-soul-of-the-high-performance-employee-then-we-can-build-the-10-000-things-ad753ffd9b7f

"Well-being and retention can only come through understanding. One of the issues to plague organizations of all sizes is a natural disconnect between executives and high-performance employees (HPEs). This disconnect affects culture, innovation and everything in-between."

### Have Fun at Work
by W. L. Livingston  
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0937063053

Much of the book is about what the individual engineer must do to succeeed despite the orgnanization. Advocates for "Skunk Works" for vital projects. 

### Disciplined Minds
by Jeff Schmidt  
http://disciplinedminds.tripod.com/

"In this riveting book about the world of professional work, Jeff Schmidt demonstrates that the workplace is a battleground for the very identity of the individual, as is graduate school, where professionals are trained. He shows that professional work is inherently political, and that professionals are hired to subordinate their own vision and maintain strict "ideological discipline." The hidden root of much career dissatisfaction, argues Schmidt, is the professional's lack of control over the political component of his or her creative work. Many professionals set out to make a contribution to society and add meaning to their lives. Yet our system of professional education and employment abusively inculcates an acceptance of politically subordinate roles in which professionals typically do not make a significant difference, undermining the creative potential of individuals, organizations and even democracy. Schmidt details the battle one must fight to be an independent thinker and to pursue one's own social vision in today's corporate society. He shows how an honest reassessment of what it really means to be a professional employee can be remarkably liberating. After reading this brutally frank book, no one who works for a living will ever think the same way about his or her job."

### Honest Business
by Michael Phillips (a founder of MasterCard)
https://www.amazon.com/Honest-Business-Michael-Phillips/dp/0394748301

"An inspirational guide to ethical business practice explains how to create and manage a small business that emphasizes openness, personal integrity, and community involvement as the keys to success."

While the book is mainly about small business, if can apply to smaller units within bigger businesses.

### Toward High-Performance Organizations: A Strategic Role for Groupware [and Bootstrapping]
by Doug Engelbart
http://dougengelbart.org/about/co-evolution.html

Engelbart suggests that healthy successful communities involve a co-evolution of tools, knowledge, culture, processes, and more -- and that we should be building learning organizations based on this principle.

### A Group is Its Own Worst Enemy
by Clay Shirky  
http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html

More and more companies revolve around both internal and external social software. Similar to one of Englebart's point, Shirky argues social software needs to be updateable to a group's emerging needs and that an online group and its software are deeply intertwined. Also, a key point is that hosting social software is more like having rental tenants (with rights) than having "users" for a desktop application. These ideas can help both in designing and selecting social software.

### Meshworks, Hierarchies, and Interfaces
by Manuel De Landa 
http://www.t0.or.at/delanda/meshwork.htm

Much of the essay is about AI design, but a key paragraph at the end about the need for an appropriate balance of both meshwork and hierarchy in all systems applies generally to all organizations:  

"To make things worse, the solution to this is not simply to begin adding meshwork components to the mix. Indeed, one must resist the temptation to make hierarchies into villains and meshworks into heroes, not only because, as I said, they are constantly turning into one another, but because in real life we find only mixtures and hybrids, and the properties of these cannot be established through theory alone but demand concrete experimentation. Certain standardizations, say, of electric outlet designs or of data-structures traveling through the Internet, may actually turn out to promote heterogenization at another level, in terms of the appliances that may be designed around the standard outlet, or of the services that a common data-structure may make possible. On the other hand, the mere presence of increased heterogeneity is no guarantee that a better state for society has been achieved. After all, the territory occupied by former Yugoslavia is more heterogeneous now than it was ten years ago, but the lack of uniformity at one level simply hides an increase of homogeneity at the level of the warring ethnic communities. But even if we managed to promote not only heterogeneity, but diversity articulated into a meshwork, that still would not be a perfect solution. After all, meshworks grow by drift and they may drift to places where we do not want to go. The goal-directedness of hierarchies is the kind of property that we may desire to keep at least for certain institutions. Hence, demonizing centralization and glorifying decentralization as the solution to all our problems would be wrong. An open and experimental attitude towards the question of different hybrids and mixtures is what the complexity of reality itself seems to call for. To paraphrase Deleuze and Guattari, never believe that a meshwork will suffice to save us."

### Birth of the Chaordic Age
by Dee Hock (founder of Visa)
https://www.amazon.com/Birth-Chaordic-Age-Dee-Hock/dp/1576750744

"In Birth of the Chaordic Age, Dee Hock argues that traditional organizational forms can no longer work because organizations have become too complex. Hock advocates a new organizational form that he calls "chaordic", or simultaneously chaotic and orderly. He credits the worldwide success of VISA with its chaordic structure -- it is owned by its member banks which both compete with each other for customers and must cooperate by honoring one another's transactions across borders and currencies. The book shows how these same chaordic concepts are now being put into practice in a broad range of business, social, community, and government organizations."

Hock's book can be seen as taking De Landa's general point above and applying it more formally to organizational design.

## Software specific:

### Mythical Man Month: Essays on Software Engineering, Anniversary Edition
by Frederick P. Brooks Jr.  
https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/

"Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time."

#### Why "Software is Hard"
http://www.gamearchitect.net/Articles/SoftwareIsHard.html

"What makes the virtual world so much more brittle and unpredictable than the physical world? Why can't we build software the way we build bridges? ... The difference is that the overruns on a physical construction project are bounded.  You never get to the point where you have to hammer in a nail and discover that the nail will take an estimated six months of research and development, with a high level of uncertainty.  But software is fractal in complexity.  If you're doing top-down design, you produce a specification that stops at some level of granularity.  And you always risk discovering, come implementation time, that the module or class that was the lowest level of your specification hides untold worlds of complexity that will take as much development effort as you'd budgeted for the rest of the project combined.  The only way to avoid that is to have your design go all the way down to specifying individual lines of code, in which case you aren't designing at all, you're just programming."

To (over) generalize on why software estimates so often go wrong: when you build a bridge, the model you use to estimate from is 1% of the effort. When you build software, building the "model" itself is 99% of the effort.

### A Conceptual Framework for System Fault Tolerance
by Walter L. Heimerdinger and Charles B. Weinstock  
http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/92tr033.pdf

"A major problem in transitioning fault tolerance practices to the practitioner community is a lack of a common view of what fault tolerance is, and how it can help in the design of reliable computer systems. This document takes a step towards making fault tolerance more understandable by proposing a conceptual framework. The framework provides a consistent vocabulary for fault tolerance concepts, discusses how systems fail, describes commonly used mechanisms for making systems fault tolerant, and provides some rules for developing fault tolerant systems."

### Systems development life cycle
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle

"The systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the application development life-cycle, is a term used in systems engineering, information systems and software engineering to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. The systems development life-cycle concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both. ... Computer systems are complex and often (especially with the recent rise of service-oriented architecture) link multiple traditional systems potentially supplied by different software vendors. To manage this level of complexity, a number of SDLC models or methodologies have been created, such as "waterfall"; "spiral"; "Agile software development"; "rapid prototyping"; "incremental"; and "synchronize and stabilize". SDLC can be described along a spectrum of agile to iterative to sequential. Agile methodologies, such as XP and Scrum, focus on lightweight processes which allow for rapid changes (without necessarily following the pattern of SDLC approach) along the development cycle. Iterative methodologies, such as Rational Unified Process and dynamic systems development method, focus on limited project scope and expanding or improving products by multiple iterations. Sequential or big-design-up-front (BDUF) models, such as waterfall, focus on complete and correct planning to guide large projects and risks to successful and predictable results. Other models, such as anamorphic development, tend to focus on a form of development that is guided by project scope and adaptive iterations of feature development."

Key point: there are a lot of possible ways of organizing software development activities depending on circumstances.

### Why do some developers at strong companies like Google consider Agile development to be nonsense?  
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-developers-at-strong-companies-like-Google-consider-Agile-development-to-be-nonsense

Where Agile works, where it does not... 

Key point: "Agile is nothing more than focusing on reducing the cost of uncertainty and change. To understand if that's a worthwhile focus, you need to know both your product and the market. Internally a company will likely have many different departments and some should definitely use Agile (R&D is a  great example) and some should definitely not (Accounting). As products/services mature, they should transition from Agile to Lean to more formal methodologies such as TQM, PRINCE2, ISO9000, and so on (interesting that there's no catch-all term for the latter)."

### On management approaches without deadlines

"Why Deadlines Need to Drop Dead"  
by Eric Elliott  
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-deadlines-need-to-drop-dead-321739ae6be1

"You can lead teams without deadlines. You can still deliver code quickly. You can still ship in time for Christmas. But you’ll be dealing with a different management framework. One that puts the deadline pressure on product managers rather than developers."

"The point here is that instead of trying to build out the CEO’s ideal vision of the product you’re bringing to market, you build out a beautiful stepping stone on the way towards that vision. In place of arbitrary deadlines, you deliver consistent, steady progress."

Advocates for marketing creating each hype cycle for what is already finished and tested.

### Why SCRUM Backlogs Lead to Bad Product Decisions
https://medium.com/product-love/why-scrum-backlogs-lead-to-bad-product-decisions-461fcf339c63#.kl4ims9ss

"At Blossom we’ve completely replaced our product backlog with a free form Google Docs file. It reads more like a marketing document than a traditional backlog. We call it our product strategy roadmap. In this file we’ve defined a few simple things on top... What are our customers hiring our product for? What kind of super powers can we give our customers? Then the body of the document consists of high level (strategic) marketing-esque announcements of (future) product improvements. Similar to what you would read in a blog post when a company like Facebook, Apple or Twitter releases a new major feature. .... Then every time space on our product board frees up we take a look at our roadmap document and pick something from it to pull into our process. This might be a full ‘announcement’ at once or more often just a subset of an announcement that we then work on step by step. The main advantage here is that we have a strategic document that’s clear and concise but at the same time very easy to change. It is very high level and mainly there to provide context for what a great execution of the strategy might be. We don’t start with specifying implementation details until we’ve actually started to work on an item. This saves a lot of time and resources that we used to spend on doing backlog estimates, re-prioritizations and groomings in the past."

### Flaws In Scrum And Agile
by Giles Bowkett  
https://www.pandastrike.com/posts/20150304-agile 

"When the Agile Manifesto was written, waterfall development was king. Agile deposed waterfall from its status as the dominant software development paradigm. Waterfall revolved around writing tedious documents, and face-to-face conversation was indeed superior to that. In 2001, Subversion was still new, Git did not exist, Skype didn't exist either, and the closest contemporary equivalent to GitHub was SourceForge. "Face-to-face conversation," in the Agile Manifesto, was "the most efficient and effective method of conveying information" because the other methods were terrible. But when you're reviewing a pull request, a GitHub diff usually beats face-to-face conversation. And this is not a fluke. Remote work requires a ton of writing, and that's one of the best things about it. How many times have you sat down to email somebody a question, and found that in the process of writing the email, the answer became obvious to you? This step is built in to the workflow of every remote team. Likewise, have you ever had to tell a co-worker the same thing twice? Technical work involves lots of tradeoffs, and people don't always remember the intricacies of every debate. But you can refer to a conversation on GitHub three years later and review every detail with perfect clarity. In a distributed company, the written word becomes much more influential than the spoken word."

### "Why “Agile” and especially Scrum are terrible

### Continuous Delivery vs. Traditional Agile
by Kief Morris  
https://dzone.com/articles/continuous-delivery-vs 

"In working with development teams at organizations which are adopting Continuous Delivery, I have found there can be friction over practices that many developers have come to consider as the right way for Agile teams to work. I believe the root of conflicts between what I’ve come to think of as traditional agile and CD is the approach to making software “ready for release”."
